I developed a catalog for a restaurant called "Kyu's Restaurant" that sells three different items: Fried Chicken, Fries, and Burger. The catalog also includes three combo meals, each combining two unique items, and a special gift pack that contains all three items plus a Coke. The purchase of single items doesnâ€™t have a discount. The prices are set for each individual item, and discounts are applied for combo meals and the gift pack based on the special considerations that were provided. It calculates the prices for different combinations, applying the specified discounts. The combo prices are determined by adding the prices of the two individual items and applying a 10% discount. The gift pack price is calculated by adding the prices of all four items and applying a 25% discount. The print statements then output the catalog in a formatted manner, displaying the product names and their corresponding prices. The combo meals and gift pack are listed with their respective combinations, making it clear for customers to understand what each option includes. The bottom part of the output provides a line for website information, encouraging customers to visit kyusrestaurantdelivery.com for deliveries.
